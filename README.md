# Personal .dotfiles

I'm using this repository to stock my personal dotfiles.

## Apps / Configurations

### fcitx5

Since I need to use the keyboard with two languages/layouts, I use this app for that.

### hypr

Yeah, I'm using hyprland... well, some of styles and ideas I "stole" from @typecraft-dev channel at [YouTube](). Another ideas I get from @Tecnosob [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Tecnosob) (it's a nice channel with content in brazilian portuguese about arch linux specially), but he doesn't have github repository (yet), but I'm very grateful for the knowledge shared in your videos.

### kitty
More inspiration in @typecraft-dev videos.

### nvim
I confess that I didn't get used to using the neovim/vim. I prefer to use nano, but neovim offers a lot of customization and makes the appearence much nicer and cleaner. I promise that I'll try to use it more.
I'm using "only" AstroVim customization.. maybe in future I'll use another plugins to make it more powerful.

### rofi

I followed one of the tricks that **Tecnosob** gave and styled it the appearence

### nwg-bar

the same thing as rofi

### zsh

I use zsh with oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k features.

## Abstract

Maybe in the future I'll detail the settings I use in each app.
